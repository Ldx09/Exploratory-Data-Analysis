Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Layoffs Using SQL
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on company layoffs data using SQL. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to workforce reductions across different companies and industries.

📂 Dataset
The analysis is conducted on the layoffs_staging2 table from the world_layoffs database. This dataset contains information on:

Number of employees laid off
Percentage of workforce affected
Companies impacted by layoffs
Financial background (funds raised)
Industry and sector insights

⚙️ SQL Queries Included
Identifying maximum and minimum layoffs
Analyzing the percentage of workforce affected
Finding companies that completely shut down (100% layoffs)
Examining layoffs based on company size and funding history
Detecting outliers and trends across industries

📊 Key Insights
Startups were significantly affected, with many shutting down completely.
Some large corporations had high layoff numbers but a smaller percentage of the workforce impacted.
Companies with higher funding did not necessarily avoid layoffs.

🛠️ Technologies Used
SQL for querying and data analysis
MySQL (or any SQL-based database)

🚀 How to Use
Load the dataset into a SQL database.
Run the provided queries to explore the data.
Modify queries to extract additional insights based on specific criteria.
